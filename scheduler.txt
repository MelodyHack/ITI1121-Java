1. What are di?erences in how the jobs are managed between FCFS and FPPS?
	
For FCFS, job are executed in the exact order that they werer introdued in the queue. 
This means if we had a queueu containing Jobs A,B,C,D and E, that entered the exactly 
in that order, they would be exectued in that every same order

For the FPPS, the way it works is with the priority system. 
This system makes sure that no matter the amount of Jobs or the time, it will always
be the Job with the highest priority that will be executed among all the tasks or jobs that 
are ready to be executed.For example, a queue containing Jobs A,B,C,D and E that came in that
order won't necessarily be exectuted in that order. It could possibly be that E was inserted 
later but had a much bigger priority than B. Therefore if all of these Jobs are ready to be 
executed, E would be executed before B.

2. What is are the advantages of FCFS over FPPS and vice versa?

The advantages to FPPS over FCFS are the following:
-It permits you to add and execute first a new element that may have bigger priority than 
what was put inside the queue before it.


The advantages to FCFS over FPPS

The fact that the FCFS doesn't have to check each and every element that is ready to be executed, 
it would seem to have the advantage of being more streamlined and quicker. This makes it better 
because there is less time wasted even thought if these were operated at a computer level, they 
would seem quicker but would have a difference of milli-seconds

3. What potential problems do you see happening if you were using an operating system with an FCFS scheduler?

Another problem is that since the jobs that are processed and executed in the order that they were chosen. 
If for example, the user decides to choose 1 job to be execute, it could be possible that this is not the 
most important job, therefore if another job is selected afterwards because the user thought this new job 
would be much more important, there would be nothing he could do since the first job has to be executed first.
If the first job is really long, it will delay the execution of a much more important job making this type of 
operating systeme inefficient at times if the wrong jobs are selected first

4. What potential problems do you see happening if you were using an operating system with an FPPS scheduler?

There are multiple problems that implicate the FPPS time of scheduler. One of those problems is the 
fact that it is preemptive, meaning it would forestall certain actions, or jobs in order to check 
which one has a higher priority. Since this is done every time a new Job or order is added, this 
would mean that the computer would have to continuously check which element has a higher priority. 
This is different from inserting a ton of elements/jobs into a queue and letting them execute in order 


From the dictonnary:

Pre-emptive:
 "serving or intended to preempt or forestall something, especially to prevent attack by disabling the enemy."
